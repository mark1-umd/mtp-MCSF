A motion profile consists of a set of trajectory points, each one of which specifies a position and velocity to be achieved during the execution of the point, and a duration in which to achieve the velocity and position. Additional attributes capture the generation algorithm details such a filter values, acceleration and time points calculated during trajectory generation so that the generated output can be more closely compared with a spreadsheet model when verifying behavior.
