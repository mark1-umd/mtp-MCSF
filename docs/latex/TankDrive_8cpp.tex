There are different types of drive systems, one of which is the \hyperlink{classTankDrive}{Tank\-Drive}. The base class, \hyperlink{classDriveSystem}{Drive\-System}, defines all of the attributes and methods which the various specific drive systems have in common. \hyperlink{classTankDrive}{Tank\-Drive} extends the definition of the \hyperlink{classDriveSystem}{Drive\-System} base class to create a derived class with attributes and methods specific to a \hyperlink{classTankDrive}{Tank\-Drive}. Note that the \char`\"{}move\char`\"{} method is a virtual method that can be accessed from a variable of the \hyperlink{classDriveSystem}{Drive\-System} base class to which a specific derived class has been assigned. The \char`\"{}move\char`\"{} method will be executed from the definition contained in the derived class -\/ in this case, the \hyperlink{classTankDrive}{Tank\-Drive}.
